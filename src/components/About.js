started in the year 2017 and the first edition took place in the January
of the following year. Over the years, IRC has established as one of the
leading space robotics competitions. In IRC 2023 there will be an
increased emphasis on creating awareness about the best practices
and methods of systems engineering. The main focus is to highlight
the benefits of an approach covering the whole project life cycle of
developing a Mars Rover. In order to achieve that, changes have been
made to the IRC Review Stages (Qualifiers) and the on-site Finals.
